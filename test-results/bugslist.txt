BUGS LIST

- dequeue's documentation says that it should return "The value of the entry at the front of the queue", however this is not possible because it is a void function.
- enqueue always adds to the front instead of the back.
- memory leaks exist and all trace back to enqueue(): most likely the destructor is not implemented properly.
